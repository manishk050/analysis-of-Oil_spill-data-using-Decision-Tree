# Analysis of Oil Spill Data Using Decision Tree

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze oil spill data using a Decision Tree algorithm. The analysis provides insights into the factors contributing to oil spills and helps predict future incidents based on historical data.

## Key Components and Files

- **oil_spill.csv**: Contains the dataset for the analysis, including various attributes related to oil spills.
- **oil_spill_using_Decision_Tree.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that implements a Decision Tree model to perform the analysis, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manishk050/analysis-of-Oil_spill-data-using-Decision-Tree.git
   cd analysis-of-Oil_spill-data-using-Decision-Tree
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the `oil_spill_using_Decision_Tree.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially.

## Notes
- Ensure the dataset is in the correct format before running the analysis.
- Adjust model parameters to improve accuracy as needed.
